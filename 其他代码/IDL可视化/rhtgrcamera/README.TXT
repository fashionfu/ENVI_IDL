Copy the .dlm and .dll files to a directory in your !DLM_PATH.  By default
!DLM_PATH is set to !PATH at startup.  You can also set your IDL_DLM_PATH
environment variable.  See the "IDL Environment System Variables" section of
the IDL docs for more information.

This is the win32 distribution.  The DLMs were built on Windows 2000 SP-4
